# CSC548-Expense_Tracker
For our semester project for Software Engineering (CSC 548), we decided to make an expense tracker, SmartSpend. The program was created to track the expense information of the user, analyze them, and help improve budgeting and saving habits. 

## Overview
This application takes in the user's expense information (name, amount, category, time period) and outputs analytics (pie chart, period breakdown) to view their spendings. It also allows users to input their budget information so they can save for their goals.

## Key Features

- **User Input**: Users can input their expense and budgeting information, which the application will process and output the necessary analytics
- **Managing Expenses**: After users add expenses to the list, they can view and delete their expenses
- **Saving Expenses**: Users can save previously added expenses, loading and adding them quickly from a drop down menu (Most useful for recurring expenses, like rent)
- **Expense Analytics**: After adding expenses, users can view a breakdown by time period, and a pie chart (categorized by expense category)
- **Budgeting/Saving Breakdown**: After adding budgeting information, users can view various analytics, including a progress bar which increases when the user adds savings
